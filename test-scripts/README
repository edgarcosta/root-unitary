This directory consists of various test scripts for the WeilPolynomials package.
These include some tests based on the paper

K.S. Kedlaya, Search techniques for root-unitary polynomials, in 
    Computational Arithmetic Geometry, Contemporary Mathematics 463, 
    American Mathematical Society, 2008, 71-82.

roots_on_unit_circle.sage: Provide a wrapper around WeilPolynomials to
    duplicate the call syntax used in the 2008 paper.

search-test.sage: Reproduce the computations from the 2008 paper.

test-roots-from-file.sage: Test whether lines in a file define Weil polynomials.

aux.sage: Miscellaneous auxiliary functions which are no longer used.
    Some of these have been incorporated into Sage.
