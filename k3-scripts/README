This directory includes scripts, based on the code in the parent directory,
to identify candidates for the zeta functions of K3 surfaces over finite 
fields.

produce-k3f1-list.sage: Script to generate monic integer polynomials of 
degrees 1, 3, ..., 21 with all roots on the unit circle.

check-k3f1-list.sage: Script to test the previous script by regenerating this
list using products of cyclotomic polynomials.

produce-k3f2-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_2. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

produce-k3f3-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_3. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

More files to be added later.
