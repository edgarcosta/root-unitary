This directory includes scripts, based on the code in the parent directory,
to identify candidates for the zeta functions of K3 surfaces over finite 
fields. Note that scripts should be executed with the current directory set 
to the parent of this directory, e.g.,
   load("k3-scripts/produce-k3f1-list.sage")

produce-k3f1-lines.sage: Script to generate monic integer polynomials of 
degrees 1, 3, ..., 21 with all roots on the unit circle.

check-k3f1-lines.sage: Script to test the previous script by regenerating this
list using products of cyclotomic polynomials.

produce-k3f2-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_2. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

produce-k3f2-full-filtered.sage: Script to reconstructed full zeta functions of
K3 surfaces over F_2 from the transcendental parts, then apply the Artin-Tate
and nonnegativity conditions.

produce-k3f3-lines.sage: Script to produce candidate zeta functions of K3
surfaces over F_3. To save space, we only record the transcendental part.

produce-k3f3-full-filtered.sage: Script to reconstructed full zeta functions of
K3 surfaces over F_3 from the transcendental parts, then apply the Artin-Tate
and nonnegativity conditions.
